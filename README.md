# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design

DriverPass Project Summary:
The client for this project was DriverPass, a business focused on helping clients pass their driver’s test at the DMV. They wanted a system that would support both in-person and online training, including features for scheduling appointments, tracking progress, providing learning materials, and offering testing functionality.

What I did particularly well:
I understood the inner workings of the process flow and what the client would need for user interaction. This helped me design a system that catered to both employees and students efficiently.

What I would revise:
I would revise my class diagram. It needs improvement to better reflect the relationships between different entities and ensure clarity in how the system's components interact.

Interpreting the user’s needs and implementation:
I interpreted the user’s needs by prioritizing ease of use and access to key features like scheduling and progress tracking. It's important to consider the user’s needs because the system should make their experience as smooth and effective as possible, ensuring the solution truly addresses their pain points.

Approach to designing software:
I start by focusing on the user rather than the technology. Understanding the requirements and the users' needs is essential because it helps shape the system to be both functional and user-friendly. In the future, I would continue using this approach and would focus on gathering user feedback early to guide the design.
